At present the high-level and low-level controller are compacted in the MCU without upper computer
Logic: 
  Setup all the control parameters
  --> Sensor pre process to reset at expected initial position for sensor feedback initial value setup
  --> Pre-detection of user posture until Standing posture is comfirmed
  --> Running main func
  --> Sensor feedback update
  --> High-level control:  -> Yaw angle reset detection -> High-level sensor feedback processing -> UID -> RTG
  --> Low-level control 
  --> Send data to PC
